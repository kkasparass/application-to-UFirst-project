This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About project criteria

Part one of the assignment can be found in the function `parseLogsData` in the `src/utils/parseLogsData` file and can be realized by selecting or dropping in a .txt file and downloading the .json file with the `download Data JSON` link. Or it can be ran as a separate script by navigating to the scripts folder and running `npx tsc ./converter.ts` and once the file has compiled `node ./converter.ts`.

The charts for part two of the assignment can be found in the file `src/components/Charts/Charts`.

## System settings

The project was made using windows with node version `v18.7.0` and npm version `8.15.0`.
